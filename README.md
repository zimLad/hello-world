# hello-world
GitHub test repository

A little about me. I am a retired construction engineer who has always been interested in computer coding. I've programmed in basic, visual basic, a little java and now mainly C#. I've used version control when programming in visual basic and now use Git locally to maintain my code. I use various computers, so I thought it was high time that I get a repository so that I could have common code that I could access from the various computers. I tried this with OneDrive, but the experience is not ideal. Before I commit to a monthly plan, I want to see how GitHub operates.
